### **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
**This worksheet is dedicated for homework 2 of Geographic Information System and Science (GISS) module in CASA. The purpose of this homework are:** \
1. The need to calculate the average percent of science students (in all) grades per county meeting the required standards; and \
2. Produce a map to show where the County averages are above or below the State of Washington average.\
\

### **DATA REQUIRED**
**The data for answering the purpose could be accessed in the following link:** \
[1. Washington Counties Map](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/kingcounty::washington-counties-with-natural-shoreline-washsh-area/explore?location=47.272700%2C-120.740400%2C7.67)\
[2. School Report Card Data](https://data.wa.gov/education/Report-Card-Assessment-Data-2018-19-School-Year/5y3z-mgxd)\
\

\
\

### **CODE**
\

#### 1. DEFINING THE DIRECTORY VARIABLE
```{r}

wd_script <- "C:/Users/USER/Documents/casa/gis/week2/week2_script"
wd_data <- "C:/Users/USER/Documents/casa/gis/week2/week2_data"
wd_img <- "C:/Users/USER/Documents/casa/gis/week2/week2_img"

```
\

#### 2. LOAD PACKAGE
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(janitor)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(RSQLite)

```
\

#### 3. IMPORT DATA
```{r}

map <- st_read("C:/Users/USER/Documents/casa/gis/week2/week2_data/Washington_Counties_with_Natural_Shoreline___washsh_area.shp")
school <- read_csv2("C:/Users/USER/Documents/casa/gis/week2/week2_data/Report_Card_Assessment_Data_2018-19_School_Year_20231013.csv", 
                    col_names=TRUE, 
                    locale=locale(encoding='latin1'),
                    na=c("n/a","NULL"))

```
\

#### 4. MANIPULATE SCHOOL TABLE
```{r}

#Drop Columns
school <- school %>%
  dplyr::select(contains("County"), 
                contains("TestSubject"),
                contains("Count of Students Expected to Test"),
                contains("CountMetStandard")) %>%
  #Drop Rows
  filter(str_detect(`TestSubject`,"Science")) %>%
  #Create New Var: percent of science students (in all) grades per county meeting the required standards
  mutate(percent_science = (`CountMetStandard`/`Count of Students Expected to Test`)*100) %>%
  drop_na(percent_science)

#Create new var: avg percent of science students (in all) grades per county meeting the required standards
summarise_county <- school %>% 
  group_by(County) %>%
  summarise(mean_percent_science=mean(percent_science))

#Create new var: avg percent of science students (in all) grades in state meeting the required standards
summarise_state <- school %>% 
  group_by(TestSubject) %>%
  summarise(mean_percent_science=mean(percent_science))

#Create new var: which is higher, county or state?
summarise_county <- summarise_county %>%
  mutate(high_low = mean_percent_science - summarise_state$mean_percent_science)

```
\

#### 5. JOIN MAP AND TABLE
```{r}

map <- map %>%
  left_join(.,
            summarise_county,
            by = c("COUNTYLABE" = "County"))

```
\

#### 6. VISUALIZE THE MAP
```{r}

tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(map) +
  tm_polygons(col="high_low",
              midpoint=0)
  

```
\

#### 7. SAVE RESULT TO GEODATABASE
```{r}

#Write geopackage
map %>%
  #write shape to new geopackage
  st_write(., "C:/Users/USER/Documents/casa/gis/week2/week2_data/export.gpkg", 
           "school_washington", 
           delete_layer = TRUE)

#Connect into database
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),dbname="export.gpkg")

#See inside database
con %>% 
  dbListTables()

#Add csv into geopackage
con %>%
  dbWriteTable(.,
               "summarise_county.csv",
               summarise_county,
               overwrite=TRUE)

#Disconnect from geopackage
con %>% 
  dbDisconnect()

```
